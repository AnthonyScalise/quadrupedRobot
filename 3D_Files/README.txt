These files are for a basic skeleton only. Support for mounting electronics must be added depending
on your design. The main files are meant for use with SG90 servos. 

I found that with my design SG90 servos were not quite strong enough for what I wanted. The files in
the MG90S folder are to be used as a replacment for the corresponding main files when using MG90S
servos. I found these servos to work much much better providing more stability. 

I did however have a problem with small vibrations being transfered through the frame when the legs
are not under compression. This caused small vibrations to be amplified by the control loop in the
firmware on each of the servos resulting in the robot having intense seizure like vibrations when
picked up and lightly shaken. 

I believe that with a redesign to make the central area smaller and thus the over all structure less
heavy SG90 servos could be comfortably used and the nylon gears would provide enough vibration
dampening to avoid this oscillation issue in contrast to the metal gears on the MG90S servos.
